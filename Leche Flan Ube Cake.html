    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Condensed milk</li>
    <li>Evaporated milk</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Cream of tartar</li>
    <li>Ube extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Caramel:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, pour 1/2 cup of sugar (optional) and melt it until it turns golden brown.
Quickly pour the caramel into the bottom of a cake pan or llanera and swirl to coat evenly. Set aside to harden.</li>
      <li>Make the Leche Flan Layer:
In a mixing bowl, combine:
4 egg yolks
1 can (300ml) condensed milk
1 can (250ml) evaporated milk
1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
Beat gently until smooth, making sure not to create too many bubbles.
Pour this mixture over the set caramel in your cake pan.</li>
      <li>Prepare the Ube Cake Batter:
Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
In a separate bowl, combine:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
In another bowl, beat together:
3 eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup oil
1 tsp cream of tartar
1/2 cup milk
2-3 tsp ube extract (adjust for desired color and flavor)
Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until smooth.</li>
      <li>Assemble the Cake:
Carefully pour the ube cake batter over the leche flan layer. Do not stir.</li>
      <li>Bake the Cake:
Cover the cake pan with aluminum foil.
Place the cake pan in a larger baking dish filled with about 1 inch of hot water to create a water bath (bain-marie).
Bake for 45–60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake layer comes out clean.</li>
      <li>Cool and Serve:
Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for best results.
To serve, carefully run a knife around the edges, then invert the cake onto a serving plate. The caramel will flow over the cake, giving it a beautiful topping.</li>
